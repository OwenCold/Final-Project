# Final-Project

**Driving Question:** 
Do companies target certain demographics based on their queerness?

**Data Sources:**
Data comes from Instagram's ads_viewed.json files from a small group of queer and non-queer young adults.

**Data Visualization:**
A Parallel Categories Diagram charting Gender, Sexuality, and Advertisers.

**Process:**
Once I decided on my topic being about queerness and social media, I began to look for data that I could use.  After looking through the data you can download through Instagram, I decided that I would look at how queer young adults are targeted by certain ads on the platform.  After this initial decision I came up with my driving question and from there began to collect data from friends and acquaintances that are young adults, both queer and non-queer.  After collecting some data, I tidied and combined all of my data to figure out if there were any results such as similar companies and once I had looked over the data I decided on the Parallel Categories Diagram as it, to me, did the best at showing these relationships.  After this, it was a matter of cleaning and adding more data until I got to a point where it looked too crowded and decided to scale it back a little.  Finally came making sure the diagram looked aesthetically pleasing to the eye and that it would be readable for the audience.  After analyzing the data I did find that certain companies did indeed only target queer people and some that only targeted non-queer people.

**Limitations and Next Steps**
The main limitation for this was the data gathering approach.  This was based on a small group of people and I would love to do something like this again with a larger sample size to see how results might change.  I would love to use a survey based approach in order to get more participants and get a much larger view on the subject, but I also feel there is merit in looking at it based on a smaller group that knows each other.  Looking at a smaller group like this, you know that they all have similar interests, so I find it interesting that there are those advertisers that only advertise to one type of person based on sexuality even though these people have much more in common.
